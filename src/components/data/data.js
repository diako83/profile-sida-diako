    "A mentally stimulating environment where you are constantly challenged and there is no end to what you can learn.",

  thirdP:
    "This led me to quit my job of eight years to pursue my goals to become a programmer. " +

  fourthP:
    "After a while at the brewery, I applied for Java development at ECUTBILDNING and was accepted for the class of 2020. I graduated in the summer of 2022. The curriculum was very intensive with a high tempo of learning. Each course was approximately a month long, starting with:",

  seventhP:
    "Though the curriculum was set, we were encouraged to learn as much as possible. The course plan was such that the students had to find source material mostly on our own, so we learned much more than the curriculum intended.",

    "I did my internship at Bybrick elevate in Örebro, which was a great experience. I got to work with amazing people and had a great time. Though I had just learned React and Java, I was put on an assignment where I got to work with Angular, C#, and .NET instead. Though I learned to use those platforms, I think the most valuable skill I gained from my time with Bybrick was to be versatile and flexible. I love learning new technologies and acquiring new skills.",

  ninthP:
    "After I graduated, I was offered a position as a developer with Bybrick, and I could not have been happier to accept. My goal to make programming/development my career had been achieved! During my employment with the company, I got to use my versatile skills and create a backend for an application with Node.js, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB in Amazon Web Services. I deployed the backend to the cloud and updated and tested the code as much as possible. Though I had a tendency to create API functions that were not needed afterward, I cleaned up and optimized the code as well as I could. We were a three-man team and worked very well together. We were commended because the project was on time and there were no major problems that hindered production.",

    "After being with the company for about five and a half months, the recession hit. So on February 16, 2022, I was let go from the company.
