    <p className="text-lg">Hello and welcome to my website. I've created this site as a substitute for a CV. I wanted to create a fun and engaging way for people to get to know me. Where  guests can look around and get to know me in a more nuanced way. I am continuously updating my website so to make it more informative and engaging. I want to show what I am up to, what skills I have accumulated, and also information about me as a person. So take your time and look around. </p>
    <p className="text-lg">Don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you want to talk about business or employment opportunities. As an overly social person, I wouldn't mind if you just wanted to have a chat. I love meeting new people. </p>
